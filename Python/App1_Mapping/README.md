This project was completed as a part of Udemy's "The Python Mega Course 2022: Build 10 Real-World Programs". For this exercise, I use pandas and folio and extract data from a
text file and a JSON file to generate a map. The map is layer controlled with the base map being a map of the world, a volcano layer that shows the locations of volcanoes in
the US, and a layer that outlines the borders of the nations of the world and highlights them based on population. Each volcano features a popup that shows on click and contains
the volcano's name (which is also a link to Google the volcano) and height. The color of the volcano markers are also determined by height.
