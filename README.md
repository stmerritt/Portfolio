Proof that I can code (updates pending)

Hello reader,

I recognize that at this time there is nothing to see here, but I will be adding to this repository in the next few weeks to show that I have software development skills. Most of my professional experience is with Visual Basic (2 years), SQL (2 years), Labview (3 years), and TestStand (2 years) for a consecutive 5 years of software development experience. I also have less than a year of experience each with CSS and HTML, Python, and JavaScript. You can expect to soon find samples of VisualBasic and Python bootcamp projects in this repository as I complete them.

Thanks for visiting!
Stephen Merritt, Electrical Engineer/Developer
