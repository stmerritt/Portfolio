# Portfolio

Hello reader,

My name is Stephen Merritt and I am a UVM Verification Engineer / Software Developer. I've been working in the tech industry since 2014 and have had experience with many different coding languages, including SystemVerilog, Python, C++, VB.NET, VHDL, Matlab, VBA, LabView, and TestStand. My goal for this portfolio is to demonstrate my coding skills in the hopes of finding a full time remote developer position, so I will be mostly showcasing my SystemVerilog, Python, C++, and VB.NET skills. I am also including some Java and Scala projects to demonstrate my ability to learn programming languages on my own. Thank you for visiting, please let me know if you have any questions or if you have any projects for which you need an additional developer.

-Stephen Merritt, Electrical Engineer/Developer
